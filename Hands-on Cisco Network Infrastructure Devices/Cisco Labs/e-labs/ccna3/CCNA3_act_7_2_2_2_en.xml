			<DESCRIPTION>Spanning-Tree protocol is a bridge protocol that utilizes the spanning-tree algorithm, enabling a learning bridge to dynamically work around loops in a network topology by creating a spanning tree.<BR/><BR/>Bridges exchange BPDU messages with other bridges to detect loops, and then remove the loops by shutting down selected bridge interfaces.<BR/><BR/>Spanning-Tree Protocol refers to both the IEEE 802.1 Spanning-Tree Protocol standard and the earlier Digital Equipment Corporation Spanning-Tree Protocol upon which it is based.<BR/><BR/>The IEEE version supports bridge domains and allows the bridge to construct a loop-free topology across an extended LAN.<BR/><BR/>The IEEE version is generally preferred over the Digital version.</DESCRIPTION>
